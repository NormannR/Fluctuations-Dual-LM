YOLO BEGIN The latter assumption is an important departure with respect to \citet{rion:halshs-02331887}, where there is no productivity wedge between open-ended and fixed-term contracts \emph{a priori}. I need this assumption to preserve the properties derived in \citet{rion:halshs-02331887}, which essentially stem from the higher slope of open-ended matches' surplus with respect to the idiosyncratic productivity compared to fixed-term matches' surplus. In \citet{rion:halshs-02331887}, the latter is a consequence of the persistence of productivity shocks. fixed-term matches experience a higher job destruction probability than open-ended contracts while facing the same frequency of productivity shocks. As a result, fixed-term matches discount the current production at a higher rate than open-ended ones, which reduces their slope with respect to the current productivity. Here, this mechanism does not intervene as idiosyncratic productivities of firm-worker pairs are i.i.d across time. YOLO END




The hiring regions of open-ended contracts and fixed-term contracts are denoted $H_t^p$ and $H_t^f$, which are defined as follows

\begin{align}
H_t^p = \left\{ z_t : J_{t}^{0,p} \left( z_t \right) \geq \max\left[ J_{t}^{f} \left( z_t \right) ,  E_{t} \beta_{t,t+1} V_{t+1}  \right] \right\}\\
H_t^f = \left\{ z_t : J_{t}^{f} \left( z_t \right) \geq \max\left[ J_{t}^{0,p} \left( z_t \right) ,  E_{t} \beta_{t,t+1} V_{t+1}  \right] \right\}
\end{align}

Firms go back to searching for a worker when the drawn idiosyncratic productivity belongs to $H_t^u = \overline{H_t^p \cup H_t^f}$.
