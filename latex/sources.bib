    abstract = { We test for a change in the volatility of 214 U.S. macroeconomic time series over the period 1959–1999. We find that approximately 80\% of these series have experienced a break in unconditional volatility during this period. Even though more than half of the series experienced a break in conditional mean, most of the reduction in volatility appears to be due to changes in conditional volatility. Our results are robust to controlling for business cycle nonlinearity in both mean and variance. Volatility changes are more appropriately characterized as instantaneous breaks than as gradual changes. Nominal variables such as inflation and interest rates experienced multiple volatility breaks and witnessed temporary increases in volatility during the 1970s. On this evidence, we conclude that the increased stability of economic fluctuations is widespread. }

abstract = {This study examines the potential impact of works councils and unions on the deployment of fixed-term contracts and agency temps. We report inter al. that works councils are associated with a higher number of temporary agency workers when demand volatility is high while the opposite holds for fixed-term contracts. These disparities likely reflect differences in function, with agency work being more directed toward the protection of a shrinking core and fixed-term contacts being as much a port of entry as a buffer stock. We are also able to identify the number of new hires with a fixed-term contract as well as the number of FTC conversions (into regular employment) and renewals, the correlates of which flows are broadly consistent with the stock data.},

abstract = "This paper presents new evidence on the patterns of price and wage adjustment in European firms and on the extent of nominal rigidities. It uses a unique dataset collected through a firm-level survey conducted in 17 European countries and covering various sectors. Several conclusions are drawn from this evidence. Firms adjust wages less frequently than prices, on average every 15 and 10months, respectively. Price and, especially, wage adjustment exhibit a substantial degree of time-dependence. In particular, wage changes tend to cluster at a specific time of the year, mostly January in the majority of countries. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that prices are more flexible when competitive pressures in product markets are strong and when labor costs account for a lower fraction of firms' total costs, whereas wages are more flexible when bargaining is decentralized and when the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Price rigidities are higher in firms with a larger share of high-skilled/white-collar workers."

 abstract = {The paper uses a generalized Nash bargain to analyze input levels, profits, and wages in the absence of binding contracts, and compares these with the conventional binding contracts model. It is shown that if the union has any power, investment is lower in the absence of binding contracts. The associated input levels and shareholders' profits are identical to those that emerge if contracts are binding and the firm acts as if it faces a cost of capital which is a linear combination of the purchase price of capital and the resale value. This implicit cost is greater than the purchase price, is an increasing function of union power, and is independent of the profit function and the alternative wage. Increases in union power reduce shareholders' profits but may increase wages at some points and decrease wages at others. In the absence of binding contracts, shareholders' profits are lower but there is a critical level of union power (depending on the profit function) such that the union is worse off if its power is higher than this level and better off if it is lower.},

In sharp contrast to leading New Keynesian models, we do not impose wage inertia. Instead we derive wage inertia from our specification of how firms and workers negotiate wages. Our model outperforms a variant of the standard New Keynesian Calvo sticky wage model. According to our estimated model, there is a critical interaction between the degree of price stickiness, monetary policy and the duration of an increase in unemployment benefits.},
