abstract = {We develop and estimate a medium scale macroeconomic model that allows for unemployment and staggered nominal wage contracting. In contrast to most existing quantitative models, employment adjustment is on the extensive margin and the employment of existing workers is efficient. Wage rigidity, however, affects the hiring of new workers. The former is introduced via the staggered Nash bargaining setup of Gertler and Trigari (2006). A robust finding is that the model with wage rigidity provides a better description of the data than does a flexible wage version. Overall, the model fits the data roughly as well as existing quantitative macroeconomic models, such as Smets and Wouters (2007) or Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). More work is necessary, however, to ensure a robust identification of the key labor market parameters.},

abstract = "This paper presents new evidence on the patterns of price and wage adjustment in European firms and on the extent of nominal rigidities. It uses a unique dataset collected through a firm-level survey conducted in 17 European countries and covering various sectors. Several conclusions are drawn from this evidence. Firms adjust wages less frequently than prices, on average every 15 and 10months, respectively. Price and, especially, wage adjustment exhibit a substantial degree of time-dependence. In particular, wage changes tend to cluster at a specific time of the year, mostly January in the majority of countries. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that prices are more flexible when competitive pressures in product markets are strong and when labor costs account for a lower fraction of firms' total costs, whereas wages are more flexible when bargaining is decentralized and when the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Price rigidities are higher in firms with a larger share of high-skilled/white-collar workers."

Lack of identification means that the empirical implications of some model parameters are either undetectable or indistinguishable from the implications of other parameters. Therefore, identifiability must be verified prior to estimation. This paper provides a simple method for conducting local identification analysis in linearized DSGE models, estimated in both full and limited information settings. In addition to establishing which parameters are locally identified and which are not, researchers can determine whether the identification failures are due to data limitations, such as lack of observations for some variables, or whether they are intrinsic to the structure of the model. The methodology is illustrated using a medium-scale DSGE model."

Applying standard data transformations induces biases in structural estimates and distortions in the policy conclusions. The proposed approach recovers important model-based features in selected experimental designs. Two widely discussed issues are used to illustrate its practical use."

Two-step procedures have problems, ranging from component misspecification to incorrect assumptions about the correlation between cyclical and non-cyclical components. In this paper, I present a one-step method, where DSGE structural parameters are jointly estimated with filtering parameters. First, I illustrate the properties of the one-step procedures using simulated data. Then, I show that different data transformations imply different structural estimates and that two-step approaches lack a statistical-based criterion to select amongst them. The one-step approach allows to choose the most likely specification of the non-cyclical component for individual series and/or to construct robust estimates by Bayesian averaging. The role of the investment specific shock as source of GDP volatility is reconsidered.},

This book introduces readers to state-of-the-art computational techniques used in the Bayesian analysis of DSGE models. The book covers Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for linearized DSGE models, novel sequential Monte Carlo methods that can be used for parameter inference, and the estimation of nonlinear DSGE models based on particle filter approximations of the likelihood function. The theoretical foundations of the algorithms are discussed in depth, and detailed empirical applications and numerical illustrations are provided. The book also gives invaluable advice on how to tailor these algorithms to specific applications and assess the accuracy and reliability of the computations. Bayesian Estimation of DSGE Models is essential reading for graduate students, academic researchers, and practitioners at policy institutions.},

Until the outbreak of the recent economic and financial crisis, Spain was leading the ranking of countries with the largest share of temporary employees. During the crisis this share has fallen to its lowest level in decades, but in the recovery the share of temporary employees is on the rise again. Indeed, last year Spanish employers formalised more contracts than ever before. A particularly striking feature is the steep rise in fixed-duration contracts lasting less than a week. We document these trends and discuss the relevance of institutional factors for the high incidence of temporary employment in Spain. In addition, we perform various econometric exercises to assess whether the surge of short-duration contracts has led to a further deterioration in the access to permanent employment.},

Our results show that workers on short-term employment contracts, who are working part-time or are not covered by a union collective agreement, are significantly less likely to be involved in any work-related training to improve or increase their skills. These findings suggest that there is a trade-off between expanding the more marginal forms of employment and expanding the proportion of the work-force getting work-related training.},

Using quantile regression we find that in West Germany the earnings of permanent and fixed-term workers are most similar among high earners and most dissimilar among low earners. In Spain, the wage penalty shows little variation across the distribution of wages. This pattern was also found for different occupational groups, although there are clear differences in the absolute wage penalty across occupations. In conclusion we caution against generalizing findings from Spain to other ‘rigid’ European labour markets.},
